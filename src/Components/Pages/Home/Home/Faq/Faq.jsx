    answer:
      "We cannot possibly answer this question precisely because there are projects finished in 2 to 3 weeks, but there are also tasks that take several years to complete. To provide you with a precise answer, we have to evaluate the project complexity and the work scope. Knowing this information, we can provide you with the estimated time frame",

    answer: "There is absolutely no need for this. After all, you do not have to know medical nuances when seeking a dentistâ€™s services. You do not have to be an expert in software development because, actually, we are. We are ready to explain to you all unclear moments and the essence of all stages while working on the project."
